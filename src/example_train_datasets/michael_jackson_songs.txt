Its close to midnight, and something evils lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight, you see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream, but terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes
Youre paralyzed

Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no ones gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know its thriller, thriller night
Youre fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight

You hear the door slam and realize theres nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand and wonder if youll ever see the sun
You close your eyes and hope that this is just imagination, girl
But all the while, you hear the creature creeping up behind
Youre out of time

Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There aint no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
Youre fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight

Night creatures calling, the dead start to walk in their masquerade
Theres no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
Theyre open wide
This is the end of your life

Theyre out to get you, theres demons closing in on every side
They will possess you unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night Ill save you from the terror on the screen

Ill make you see

That this is thriller, thriller night
Cause I can thrill you more than any ghost would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a
Killer, diller, chiller, thriller here tonight

Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more than any ghost would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller, ow!
Im gonna thrill ya tonight

Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize yalls neighborhood

Im gonna thrill ya tonight, ooh baby
Im gonna thrill ya tonight, oh darlin
Thriller night, baby, ooh!
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller

What about sunrise
What about rain
What about all the things
That you said we were to gain...
What about killing fields
Is there a time
What about all the things
That you said was yours and mine...
Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood weve shed before
Did you ever stop to notice
The crying Earth the weeping shores?

Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh

What have we done to the world
Look what weve done
What about all the peace
That you pledge your only son...
What about flowering fields
Is there a time
What about all the dreams
That you said was yours and mine...
Did you ever stop to notice
All the children dead from war
Did you ever stop to notice
The crying Earth the weeping shores

Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh

I used to dream
I used to glance beyond the stars
Now I dont know where we are
Although I know weve drifted far

Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh

Hey, what about yesterday
What about us
What about the seas
What about us

What about natures worth

What about us
What about animals

Weve turned kingdoms to dust
What about us
What about elephants
What about us
Have we lost their trust
What about us
What about crying whales
What about us
Were ravaging the seas
What about us
What about forest trails
Ooo, ooo
Burnt despite our pleas
What about us
What about the holy land
What about it
Torn apart by creed
What about us
What about the common man
What about us
Cant we set him free
What about us
What about children dying
What about us
Cant you hear them cry
What about us
Where did we go wrong

Another day has gone
Im still all alone
How could this be
Youre not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though youre far away
I am here to stay

But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though were far apart
Youre always in my heart
You are not alone

Alone, alone
Why, alone

Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though youre far away
I am here to stay

But you are not alone
And I am here with you
Though were far apart
Youre always in my heart
For you are not alone

Whisper three words and Ill come runnin
And I and girl you know that Ill be there
Ill be there

You are not alone
I am here with you
Though youre far away
I am here to stay

For you are not alone
I am here with you
Though were far apart
Youre always in my heart

For you are not alone you are not alone
For I am here with you I am here with you
Though youre far away though youre far away
You and me I am here to stay

For you are not alone you are always in my heart
For I am here with you though were far apart
Youre always in my heart

For you are not alone not alone, oh

I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy is that girl with you?
Yes were one and the same

Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight

But, if youre thinkin about my baby
It dont matter if youre black or white

They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them I aint second to none

And I told about equality and its true
Either youre wrong or youre right

But, if youre thinkin about my baby
It dont matter if youre black or white

I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
Sew when the going gets rough
I aint scared of your brother
I aint scared of no sheets
I aint scared of nobody
Girl, when the going gets mean

Protection
For gangs, clubs, and nations
Causing grief in human relations
Its a turf war on a global scale
Id rather hear both sides of the tale
See, its not about races
Just places, faces
Where your blood comes from
Is were your space is
Ive seen the bright get duller
Im not going to spend my life being a color

Dont tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye

But, if youre thinkin about my baby
It dont matter if youre black or white

I said if youre thinkin of being my baby
It dont matter if youre black or white

I said if youre thinkin of being my brother
It dont matter if youre black or white

Ooh, ooh
Yea, yea, yea now
Ooh, ooh
Yea, yea, yea now

Its black, its white
Its tough for you to get by yeah, yeah, yeah
Its black, its white

Its black, its white
Its tough for you to get by yeah, yeah, yeah
Its black, its white

Wow! Mommys kissing Santa Claus!
I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus
Underneath the mistletoe last night
She didnt see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peep
She thought that I was tucked up
In my bedroom, fast asleep

Then I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus
Tickle, tickle, Santa Claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night

He saw Mommy kissing kissing, kissing Santa Claus
I did! I really did see Mommy kissing Santa Claus
And Im gonna tell my Dad

Then I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus
Tickle, tickle Santa Claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night

Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night

I did! I did! I really did see Mommy kissing Santa Claus
You gotta believe me! You just gotta believe me!
Come on, fellas, believe me!
You just gotta believe me!
I told you, I told you

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said dont mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful of what you do
And dont go around breaking young girls hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do cause the lie becomes the truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
Shes just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when shes in demand
Her schemes and plans
Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
Dont think twice, dont think twice

She told my baby wed danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine oh, no!
Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby

People always told me be careful of what you do
And dont go around breaking young girls hearts
She came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

Billie Jean is not my lover
Shes just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover
Shes just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover
Shes just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

She says I am the one,
You know what you did, she says he is my son breaking my heart babe
She says I am the one

Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover dont Billie Jean
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
